// This code represents a simplified Node.js application that serves static files through a /public directory using
//  the express.static middleware.
// The vulnerable code snippet demonstrates improper asset management, where all files within the public directory are
//  accessible to anyone requesting them.
// There are no access controls or restrictions in place, potentially exposing sensitive files and information to
//  unauthorized users.

// Mitigation 

// This code snippet includes mitigation measures to address the Improper Assets Management vulnerability.

const express = require('express');
const path = require('path');

const app = express();

// Secure static file serving
app.use('/public', express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));

// ...

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server started on port 3000');
});

// In the updated code, several measures have been implemented to mitigate the Improper Assets Management
//  vulnerability.
// The static file serving is restricted to the /public path using the app.use() middleware.
// The path.join(__dirname, 'public') ensures that the static files are served from the absolute path, rather than 
// a relative path, preventing unauthorized access to files outside the designated directory.
// By properly configuring the static file serving, you limit access to only the necessary files and directories,
//  preventing unauthorized users from accessing sensitive assets
